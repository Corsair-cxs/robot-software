# Raspberry as server to debug/flash

Features :
 * Firmware upload
 * (done) Acces the USB shell                                          
 * (done) Connect to the CAN traffic                                   
 * (try with gpio first) the STLink for firmware upload                               
 * (done) power the raspi through the CAN bus                          
 * use openocd GPIO adapter instead of st link, might work better?

 To do:
 * find how to flash via pi gpio
 * Try to scp build and flash it
 * build a small thing for can-bus (so it doesn't break the chain)


# Setup rasppi
### Update and upgrade the pi
```BASH
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
### Install Python3 and Co
```BASH
sudo apt install python3
```
```BASH
sudo apt install python3-pip && pip3 install cvra-bootloader
```
```BASH
pip3 install pyserial
```
### Update $PATH to find python
```BASH
vim ~/.bashrc 
```
### and add at the end of the file
```BASH
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/
```
```BASH
sudo apt install openocd
```
Check if I really had to install libqueue

# On your computer 
To save your public to the raspberry.
```BASH
ssh-copy-id <USERNAME>@<IP-ADDRESS>
```
```BASH
scp fun pi@192.168.43.229:test/. && ssh pi@192.168.43.229 "mv test/* ."
```

# Type representing a setpoint for a single RC servomotor control
# The positions, velocity and acceleration are all between 0 and 1,
# corresponding to 0-100% PWM.
#
# The period is fixed to 20 ms.
#
# Note that a typical range for a servo motor would be between 1 and 2 ms on
# time, therefore having a duty cycle of between 5 to 10%


float16 position        # dimensionless, between 0 and 1
float16 velocity        # dimensionless, unit is s^-1
float16 acceleration    # dimensionless, unit is s^-2

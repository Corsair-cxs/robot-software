# Motor board - Build logs

## June 2015

Our robot concept won the jury award at the SwissEurobot competition.

## May 2015

Wiring of the robots is ongoing.
If you didn't trust us when we told you the board fits on the back of an RC servo, here is a picture of the main robot's arm featuring three grippers each driven by a hobby RC servo modified using our motor boards.

## April 2015

The firmware is all done, or at least good enough for now.
Four of our members spent 20 hours over a weekend to assemble the remaining 55 boards.

We split tasks with one person testing boards, and the three others applying the solder paste on the boards using a stencil and placing the components on the board.
We turned this space into a Shenzhen factory.

We made a board holder out of plaster so we could easily solder boards in batches of five in our toaster oven.

And here they are, fresh out of the oven, 55 motor boards soldered and tested.

Don't stare too much or you might get hypnotised

## February 2015

We received the PCBs and components.
We took an evening to solder 5 of them.
The firmware is being written, we're having issues with the measurement of the current, the selected opamp doesn't have the desired response to common mode.
We're working on a software fix.

## January 2015

The board design is done.
It passed review, and we ordered 100 PCBs and components for assembling 60 boards.
We only need about 40 boards for our two robots, but we need spares too, better safe than sorry.

The final version is 30.8mm by 16.0mm and fits on the back of a big hobby RC servo.

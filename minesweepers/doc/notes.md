Minesweepers
============

Surface mines are more important, as when you touch them it's over.
Flying stuff is easier for that.

No viable alternatives to UWB for positioning.


# Timeline

- Positioning first: UWB
- Vision for surface mines
- Hardware (quad + pixhawk)
- ROS setup

- Hardware for buried mines


# Questions to ask

- Does flying over buried mines without detection go under passover and deduct points?
- How is a full scan of the field determined?
- Where are the mine field pictures? What kind of obstacles are there? Texture & geometry?
- Where can we get dummy mines or a data set?
- If we have one autonomous and one remote controlled robot, do we still get the bonus?
